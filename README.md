<h2>Summary</h2>
I am a star wars fan and my favorite character has to be Darth Vador. I like his story and his character development throughout the films. I developed this App because I wanted to work with the Star Wars API. I retrieve data from the API using fetch and display it on a card. I used Link to navigate through the routes and also decided to implement useEffect and useState hooks. I learned new concepts and how to fetch data from APIs and solified my understanding of how to use react hooks specically useEffect and useState.
